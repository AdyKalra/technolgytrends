## Infrastructure configuration scanner

Delivery teams need to take ownership of their entire stack, including infrastructure. This means increased responsibility in the delivery team itself for configuring the infrastructure in a safe, secure and compliant way. 

When adopting cloud strategies, most organizations default to a tightly locked-down and centrally managed configuration to reduce risk, but this also creates substantial productivity bottlenecks. 

```An alternative approach is to allow teams to manage their own configuration and use an``` **infrastructure configuration scanner** ```to ensure the configuration is safe and secure. Options include open-source scanners such as``` [prowler](https://github.com/toniblyx/prowler) ```for ``` **AWS** ```and``` [kube-bench](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/kube-bench) ```for``` **Kubernetes** ``` installations. For more continuous detection, take a look at cloud platforms such as AWS Config Rules among other commercial services.```
