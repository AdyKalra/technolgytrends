```The thorough ```[State of DevOps](https://cloud.google.com/devops/) ```reports have focused on data-driven and statistical analysis of high-performing organizations. The result of this multiyear research, published in ```[Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/)```, demonstrates a direct link between organizational performance and software delivery performance. The researchers have determined that only four key metrics differentiate between low, medium and high performers:``` **lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR) and change fail percentage.** ``` 

Indeed, we've found that these four key metrics are a simple and yet powerful tool to help leaders and teams focus on measuring and improving what matters. A good place to start is to instrument the build pipelines so you can capture the four key metrics and make the software delivery value stream visible.

```The State of DevOps report, first published in 2014, states that high-performing teams create high-performing organizations. Recently, the team behind the report released Accelerate, which describes the scientific method they've used in the report. 

A key takeaway of both are the four key metrics to support software delivery performance: lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR), and change fail percentage. As a consultancy that has helped many organizations transform, these metrics have come up time and time again as a way to help organizations determine whether they're improving the overall performance. 

Each metric creates a virtuous cycle and focuses the teams on continuous improvement: to reduce lead time, you reduce wasteful activities which, in turn, lets you deploy more frequently; deployment frequency forces your teams to improve their practices and automation; your speed to recover from failure is improved by better practices, automation and monitoring which reduces the frequency of failures.```
