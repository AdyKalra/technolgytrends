## Cypress

``` We keep receiving positive feedback on "post-Selenium" web UI testing tools such as``` [Cypress,](http://www.cypress.io/) [TestCafe](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/testcafe) ```and``` [Puppeteer.](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/puppeteer) ```

Running end-to-end tests can present challenges, such as the long duration of the running process, the flakiness of some tests and the challenges of fixing failures in CI when running tests in headless mode. Our teams have had very good experiences with Cypress by solving common issues such as lack of performance and long wait time for responses and resources to load. Cypress has become the tool of choice for end-to-end testing within our teams
