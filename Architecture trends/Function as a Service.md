* 1. **Microsoft Azure Functions**: Developed by Microsoft, this is an event-driven, compute-on-demand experience that extends the existing Azure application platform with capabilities to implement code triggered by events occurring in Azure or third-party services as well as on-premises systems.

* 2. **Google Cloud Functions**: This is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services, developed under Google Cloud Platform. With these, you write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services.

* 3. **AWS Lambda Functions**: Part of Amazon Web Services, this is a serverless computing service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying computing resources for you. You can use these to collaborate with other AWS services with custom logic or create your own back-end services that operate at AWS scale, performance and security.

* 4. **Iron.io**: This is an open source function as a service platform. Since containers are used as the building blocks, it can be written in any language. Moreover, it has the ability to run in the private, public or hybrid cloud.

* 5. **IBM Cloud Functions**: Developed by IBM, based on Apache OpenWhisk, this is a FaaS programming platform which supports multiple languages for delivering code which is lightweight that scalably executes on demand.

 6. * **Docker**: Docker is an open platform for developers to build, ship and run distributed applications. It provides CaaS which are lightweight by design and perfect for enabling microservices application development. You can use this to containerize the functions, then run them on-demand on a Docker Swarm.

* 7. **PubNub Functions**: These are serverless functions which enables you to quickly develop microservices and incorporate logic like-routing, augmenting, filtering, transforming and aggregating data.

* 8. **Binaris**: It is a pioneer in providing function as a service. The focus is given over every millisecond at the 99th percentile. It is suitable for real-time bidding, AR, cognitive computing, interactive games, etc. where unpredictable response time is not an option.

* 9. **Bitnami-Kubeless**: THis is a Kubernetes-native serverless platform which let you deploy serverless functions. It is designed to deploy on the top of Kubernetes cluster, in such a manner, that you can take advantage of all the Kubernetes primitives.

* 10. **Nuclio**: An open serverless platform which is efficient and faster than bare-metal code. It brings hybrid functionality and works with data and event sources to enable excellent performance and development. It can be used for IoT devices, on-premises datacenters, cloud deployments eliminating cloud lock-ins and enabling hybrid solutions.

* 11. **Nano Lambda**: These are useful when you want to execute a function without having to name it. It can be also used to pass one function to other functions to do stuff. For example, Lambda architecture allows you to run ad-hoc queries against all of your data to get results, or real to incoming data for real-time, event-driven micro-services.

* 12. **OpenFaaS**: This let you to pack anything as a serverless function- from Node.js to Golang to Sharp, event binaries like ffmpeg. These are known for being a developer first, operational simplicity and community-centric.
