## Design Tokens

* When faced with the challenge of using a design system consistently across many form factors and platforms, the team at Salesforce came up with the concept of [design tokens.](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/living-design-system-3ab1f2280ef7#.r26jko9u3) 
* The tokens store values, such as colors and fonts, in one central place. **This makes it possible to separate options from decisions, and it significantly improves collaboration between teams.**
* Design tokens are not new, but with the introduction of tools like Tailwind CSS and Style Dictionary, we see design tokens being used more often.
