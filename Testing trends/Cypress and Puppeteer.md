## Cypress

``` We keep receiving positive feedback on "post-Selenium" web UI testing tools such as``` [Cypress,](http://www.cypress.io/) [TestCafe](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/testcafe) ```and``` [Puppeteer.](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/puppeteer) ```
* **JavaScript End to End Testing Framework**

* Running end-to-end tests can present challenges, such as the long duration of the running process, the flakiness of some tests and the challenges of fixing failures in CI when running tests in headless mode. Our teams have had very good experiences with Cypress by solving common issues such as lack of performance and long wait time for responses and resources to load. Cypress has become the tool of choice for end-to-end testing within our teams

* Cypress automatically includes jQuery and exposes it as Cypress.

* Cypress has the capability to run tests across multiple browsers. Currently, Cypress has **support for Chrome-family browsers (including Electron) and beta support for Firefox browsers.** Tests that require the chromeWebSecurity configuration option to be disabled may experience issues in non-Chromium based browsers.

*  **Puppeteer is faster than Selenium, but it works only with Chrome, while Selenium works with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Edge.**
