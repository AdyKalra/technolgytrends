**creating failures and outages in a controlled environment**

## Chaos Engineering
```accepted, mainstream approach to improving and assuring distributed system resilience. As organizations large and small begin to implement Chaos Engineering as an operational process, we're learning how to apply these techniques safely at scale.``` 

The approach is definitely not for everyone, and to be effective and safe, it requires organizational support at scale. Industry acceptance and available expertise will definitely increase with the appearance of commercial services such as [Gremlin](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/gremlin) and deployment tools such as [Spinnaker](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/tools/spinnaker) implementing some Chaos Engineering tools.


**Chaos Katas** ```is a technique that our teams have developed to train and upskill infrastructure and platform engineers. It combines Chaos Engineering techniques—that is, creating failures and outages in a controlled environment—with the systematic teaching and training approach of Kata.```

Here, [Kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata) refers to code patterns that trigger controlled failures, allowing engineers to discover the problem, recover from the failure, run postmortem and find the root cause. Repeated execution of Katas helps engineers to internalize their new skills.
