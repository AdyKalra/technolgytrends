* **Contentful** is the **platform where you can update the content of your website, a mobile app or any other platform that displays content.** We save you the time and hassle to create your own backend to manage the content, and provide many tools which make it easier to actually generate a website or app.
* **Contentful is not a CMS. Yes, Contentful can do everything a traditional CMS can do.** ... This means that you as a developer **get your data in and out of the Contentful platform using API calls** This is what makes Contentful a **headless** and decoupled solution for managing content.
* **RESTful API** Our stateless API with compact JSON payloads gives you full programmatic control over your content management system, including assets, translations and other versions.
* **Microservices architecture** The fully decoupled write and read APIs ensure a fault-tolerant service that evolves without breaking your CMS or apps.
* **Optimized for speed** Advanced caching techniques are integrated tightly with external CDNs to deliver API payloads in the sub-100 ms range.
* **Mobile-friendly** Your content will be fully optimized to deliver stellar mobile performance thanks to selective sync, image auto-compression, and support for offline persistence.
