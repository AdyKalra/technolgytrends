#### Blazing fast cloud developer environments
**Visual Studio Code backed by high performance VMs that start in seconds.**

[codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

Use the full power of Visual Studio Code, including the editor, terminal, debugger, GitHub Copilot, version control, settings sync, and the entire ecosystem of extensions. Work in the browser or hand off to your desktop.

A talk at Black Hat has demonstrated that Microsoft Copilot bots are insecure because of inadequate defaults and other problems that leave them open to attack. Many of these issues have been fixed since the talk, but changes only affect new installations.

### Faster than your laptop

* Spin up new dev environment for any sized project in seconds with prebuilt images. GitHub’s own 35GB dev image starts in under 10 seconds. Scale your cloud VMs up to 32 cores and 64GB of RAM. And with low-latency connections across four regions, you won’t even remember it’s not your local machine.

* CPUs up to 32 cores
* Memory up to 64 GB
* Spin up <10 sec

### Standardized dev environments

Join a new team and just start coding. Standardize environments, runtime requirements, hardware specs, extensions and editor settings in .devcontainer.json configuration files. Isolate dependencies between projects with containers and docker-compose.

### Browser preview and port forwarding

Preview your changes in the browser with instant reloads (websocket and HMR support) and share private and public ports with your teammates.

### Tabs, spaces, Monokai, Solarized, light, dark, Prettier, Beautify…

Every nerdy detail only you care about, configured just right, backed by your own dotfiles repository.
