## CUPID

* How do you approach writing good code? How do you judge if you've written good code? As software developers, we're always looking for catchy rules, principles and patterns that we can use to share a language and values with each other when it comes to writing simple, easy-to-change code.

* Daniel Terhorst-North has recently made a new attempt at creating such a checklist for good code. He argues that instead of sticking to a set of rules like [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), using a set of properties to aim for is more generally applicable. He came up with what he calls the **CUPID properties to describe what we should strive for to achieve "joyful" code: Code should be composable, follow the Unix philosophy and be predictable, idiomatic and domain based.**

### The five CUPID properties are:

* Composable: plays well with others
* Unix philosophy: does one thing well
* Predictable: does what you expect
* Idiomatic: feels natural
* Domain-based: the solution domain models the problem domain in language and structure
