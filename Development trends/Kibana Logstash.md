* Kibana uses **Elasticsearch which is a full-text, distributed NoSQL database.** In other words, it uses documents rather than schema or tables. It's a free, open source tool that allows for real-time searching and analyzing of your data.
* **Logstash** is the AWS alternative for Elasticsearch. Logstash is a light-weight, open-source, server-side data processing pipeline that allows you to collect data from a variety of sources, transform it on the fly, and send it to your desired destination. It is most often used as a data pipeline for Elasticsearch, an open-source analytics and search engine. Because of its tight integration with Elasticsearch, powerful log processing capabilities, and over 200 pre-built open-source plugins that can help you easily index your data, Logstash is a popular choice for loading data into Elasticsearch.
