### Interviewers only care about how you think about the data flow in your application. All you need to do is convert this factor into your respective development paradigm.

* For **backend developers**, this would involve **data model design, API segregation, routing, microservice segregation, choice of a networking protocol with a few touchpoints for a cloud solution.**
* For **frontend developers**, this would involve **frequency and amount of data being refreshed and event handling.** Of course, there will be some points assigned to the UI attractiveness factor, but for the most part, it would involve presenting the data.
* For **mobile developers**, this would involve **API consumption, local storage, domain model design, screen navigation, and most importantly, how the data flows from one screen to another screen, from the device to the backend**, and so on.
