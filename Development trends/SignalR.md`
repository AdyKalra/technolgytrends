[SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction?view=aspnetcore-5.0)

SignalR is an **open-source library that simplifies adding real-time web functionality to apps. Real-time web functionality enables server-side code to push content to clients instantly.**

### Good candidates for SignalR:

- Apps that require high frequency updates from the server. Examples are gaming, social networks, voting, auction, maps, and GPS apps.
- Dashboards and monitoring apps. Examples include company dashboards, instant sales updates, or travel alerts.
- Collaborative apps. Whiteboard apps and team meeting software are examples of collaborative apps.
- Apps that require notifications. Social networks, email, chat, games, travel alerts, and many other apps use notifications.

SignalR provides an API for creating server-to-client remote procedure calls (RPC). The RPCs call JavaScript functions on clients from server-side .NET Core code.

Here are some features of SignalR for ASP.NET Core:

- Handles connection management automatically.
- Sends messages to all connected clients simultaneously. For example, a chat room.
- Sends messages to specific clients or groups of clients.
- Scales to handle increasing traffic.
