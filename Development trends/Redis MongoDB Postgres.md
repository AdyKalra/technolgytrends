* Redis is an **in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed, in-memory key-value database with optional durability.** Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indexes
* **Is NoSQL a Redis?** The short answer is yes. Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store. There are actually 4 different kinds of NoSQL database types, which include: **Document Databases – (MongoDB) These DBs usually pair each key with a complex data structure which is called a document.**\
* Redis is faster at a key/value scenario if you just need to put get and put some binary data by a primary key. **MongoDB is faster if you have lots of data that doesn't fit in RAM** (since Redis won't even work for that). **MongoDB is easier if you need to spread your data across several servers automatically.**
* PostgreSQL (/ˈpoʊstɡrɛs ˌkjuː ˈɛl/), also known as **Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance**. ... It is the default database for macOS Server, and is also available for Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Windows.
* A gain in Postgres popularity may have come from a number of reasons: .**features and performance as well as scalability make it a proper alternative for applications where traditionally Oracle DB was hard to replace.**. its more recent features for .**Key-Value-Storage (JSON / JSONB column type).** make it an alternative to NoSQL- ...
