* AWS CloudFormation is a **service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Services resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS.**
* **CloudFormation Template** A template is a declaration of the AWS resources that make up a stack. The template is stored as a text file whose format complies with the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or YAML standard.
* AWS CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. This gives you a single source of truth for your AWS and third party resources.
* AWS CloudFormation automatically uploads your template to an S3 bucket in your AWS account.
* **Terraform uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**, developed to strike a balance between being human readable as well as machine-friendly. CloudFormation, on the other hand, uses either JSON or YAML.
* When you create a stack, AWS CloudFormation makes underlying service calls to AWS to provision and configure your resources. Note that AWS CloudFormation can perform only actions that you have permission to do. For example, to create EC2 instances by using AWS CloudFormation, you need permissions to create instances.
