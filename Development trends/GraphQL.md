* GraphQL is an open-source **data query and manipulation language for APIs**, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. GraphQL was developed internally by **Facebook in 2012** before being publicly released in 2015.
* **GraphQL** is a syntax that describes how to ask for data, and is generally used to load data from a server to a client. GraphQL has three main characteristics: It lets the client specify exactly what data it needs. It makes it easier to aggregate data from multiple sources
* GraphQL is typically **served over HTTP via a single endpoint** which expresses the full set of capabilities of the service. This is in contrast to REST APIs which expose a suite of URLs each of which expose a single resource. 
* **GraphQL services typically respond using JSON**, however the GraphQL spec does not require it. JSON may seem like an odd choice for an API layer promising better network performance, however because it is mostly text, it compresses exceptionally well with GZIP.
