# AWS Auto Scaling
* AWS Auto Scaling **monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost.**
* lets you build scaling plans for resources including **Amazon EC2 instances** and **Spot Fleets, Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon DynamoDB tables and indexes, and Amazon Aurora Replicas.**
* AWS Auto Scaling makes scaling simple with recommendations that allow you to optimize performance, costs, or balance between them. 
* If youâ€™re already using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to dynamically scale your Amazon EC2 instances, you can now combine it with AWS Auto Scaling to scale additional resources for other AWS services.
