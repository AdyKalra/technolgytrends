### LLM-backed ChatOps / LLMOps
- It's an emerging application of large language models through a chat platform (primarily Slack) that allows engineers to build, deploy and operate software via natural language.
- This has the potential to streamline engineering workflows by enhancing the discoverability and user-friendliness of platform services.
- Two early examples are [PromptOps](https://www.querypal.com/) and [Kubiya](https://www.kubiya.ai/product/overview). However, considering the finesse needed for production environments, organizations should thoroughly evaluate these tools before allowing them anywhere near production.
