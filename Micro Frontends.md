## Micro Frontends
```We've seen significant benefits from introducing``` [microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)```, which have allowed teams to scale the delivery of independently deployed and maintained services. 

Unfortunately, we've also seen many teams create a frontend monolith — a large, entangled browser application that sits on top of the backend services — largely neutralizing the benefits of microservices.```

Since we first described **micro frontends** as a technique to address this issue, we've had almost universally positive experiences with the approach and have found a number of patterns to use micro frontends even as more and more code shifts from the server to the web browser. 

So far, [web components](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/web-components-standard) have been elusive in this field, though.
