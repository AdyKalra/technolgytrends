* React. js is an **open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications.** It's used for handling the **view layer for web and mobile apps**. React also allows us to create **reusable UI components.**
* React is a frontend library, which runs in the browser. Like any other frontend library (jQuery, etc), it is happy to be served by any old webserver – Apache, NGINX – or any kind of backend – PHP, Rails, and so on
