* **The pipelines as code** technique emphasizes that the configuration of delivery pipelines that build, test and deploy our applications or infrastructure should be treated as code; they should be placed under source control and modularized in reusable components with automated testing and deployment. 
  * As organizations move to decentralized autonomous teams building microservices or micro frontends, the need for engineering practices in managing pipelines as code increases to keep building and deploying software consistent within the organization.
  * This need has given rise to delivery pipeline templates and tooling that enable a standardized way to build and deploy services and applications. 
  * Such tools use the declarative delivery pipelines of applications, adopting a pipeline blueprint to execute the underlying tasks for various stages of a delivery lifecycle such as build, test and deployment; and they abstract away implementation details. 
* The ability to build, test and deploy pipelines as code should be one of the evaluation criteria for choosing a CI/CD tool.

* Teams are pushing for automation across their environments(testing), including their development infrastructure. Pipelines as code is defining the deployment pipeline through code instead of configuring a running CI/CD tool. 
* LambdaCD, Drone, GoCD and Concourse are examples that allow usage of this technique. Also, configuration automation tools for CI/CD systems like GoMatic can be used to treat the deployment pipeline as codeâ€”versioned and tested.
