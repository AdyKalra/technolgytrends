*  Increased infrastructure automation helps free up engineers from focusing too much on managing DevOps when they really should be building out new features.
*  It supports the emerging discipline of platform engineering and can increase scalability and reactivity to unforeseen events, enabling software ecosystems to be more anti-fragile.

*  But introducing more infrastructure abstraction can be met with certain challenges. This is often because departments have a wide range of cultures, processes and tooling already in place. With varying maturity levels across teams, it can be challenging to gauge where a company is before attempting to introduce new automation across the board. And as further evolution may require significant changes, having a baseline is key to planning for the future


### infrastructure automation maturity model breaks down the journey into four unique stages, moving from the least-mature ad-hoc automation to the most-mature autonomous solutions.
#### Four Questions to Determine Infrastructure Maturity
DevOps is still a wild west in terms of how people approach it, said Williams. So before attempting to mandate sweeping cultural changes, it helps to first determine the base level of DevOps maturity within an organization. Here are four questions that can quickly assess the state of infrastructure automation within an organization.
1. What Culture Already Exists?
First, it’s good to evaluate the culture that already exists. How do teams deliver value and how is this value measured? Perhaps throughput or code quality is measured with specific metrics or SLAs. **Understanding the DevOps attitude (and aptitude) within the organization will highlight pre-existing capabilities and show how teams collaborate.**
2. How Are People Organized?
The genetic makeup of teams can dictate much about development and operations. How are teams organized? Are they large, siloed teams? Or are they two-pizza-sized teams? Understanding team organization and communication patterns are necessary to identify bottlenecks.

3. What Processes Are Already in Place?
Next, consider the development timelines and procedures already established and in use. Are teams applying SAFe, Lean, Agile or Scrum methodologies? What are these exact processes and how mature are they? Answers to these questions will demonstrate general release cadences and how teams drive productization.

4. What Infrastructure Automation is Already Being Used?
Lastly, you’ll need a window into what level of infrastructure automation, if any, is already in use today. How is it delivered? How is it managed? How is the success of this automation measured, and what is the overall outcome? You will likely find that automation is typically quite siloed and teams have differing approaches. This auditing is vital to identify what works well and what doesn’t.

## The Four Levels of the Infrastructure Automation Maturity Model
Asking the above questions will quickly determine an organization’s “readiness state,” But how do these answers map to the overall maturity of the organization’s infrastructure automation? Well, he shared four basic levels of infrastructure automation maturity that are commonly found in practice throughout today’s software development environments, ranging from bespoke scripts to more robust self-defining automation.

**Level 1: Ad-hoc**
The most basic level of infrastructure automation is ad-hoc integrations involving a mix of old and new technology. This level is chaotic and fragmented, with varying processes used throughout the organization. These bespoke integrations and scripts also may not have excellent visibility, limiting the potential for reusability within an organization.

**Level 2: Automation**
Next is having automation that is specifically tied to a certain technology stack. Nowadays, organizations are commonly hybrid multi-cloud, having adopted automation piecemeal with each new stack. This often results in multiple silos of automation stacks that are blind to each other. At this maturity level, one automation might fire off another automated procedure and so on, but engineers aren’t 100% aware of how they influence each other.

**Level 3: Frictionless**
The next level of infrastructure maturity begins to take the reins with more intentional automation adoption. At this stage, organizations embrace an internal developer platform, similar to Spotify’s Backstage, that helps engineers deliver and manage infrastructure more seamlessly. This tooling is more advanced than other levels integrating key commands into the developer’s IDE. Doing so eliminates the need to switch between environments and reduces friction.

**Level 4: Self-Defining**
Finally, the most advanced form of automation involves deeper intelligence within application operations, including the ability to dynamically optimize infrastructure. At this stage, infrastructure is self-defining, meaning production applications can automatically adapt, be self-governed and enable bursting and non-bursting capabilities. Such intelligence is typically proprietary to cloud providers, yet companies often desire this intelligence inherent at the application level.  describes this stage as the **“intelligent allocation of resources in line with application life cycle requirements.”**
#### Benefits of Self-Defining Infrastructure Automation
Self-defining infrastructure automation has many benefits for companies, including having the infrastructure in line with application needs, scalability and measuring usage to optimize cloud spending. Many points within the software development life cycle could warrant increased automation, such as infrastructure-as-code (IaC), deployment release engines, configuration, traffic scalability, cloud management, containerization and documentation. But it’s not until you open conversations around infrastructure automation maturity and understand who is responsible for managing it that you can hone in on what areas can be improved.
