##Infrastructure-as-apps 
builds on infrastructure-as-code to a logical endpoint by bringing in principles of GitOps management. The term is something I coined in 2021 to describe an existing movement to bring infrastructure into the same lifecycle control as applications under GitOps. Examples of Infra-as-apps tools include Argo CD, Crossplane, Cluster API, Cello, or even SchemaHero for databases and the list is always growing.

Some of the benefits of infra-as-apps include

Dramatically easier infrastructure management
Better security
Easier onboarding and resource provisioning for devs
Faster mean time to recover (MTTR)
Ironclad auditability
Better cost management
Cross-cloud and easier migration
Read on to understand why.
