## Vulnerability Impact Scoring System
- Zoom recently open-sourced its [Vulnerability Impact Scoring System, or VISS](https://viss.zoom.com/).
- This system is mainly focused on vulnerability scoring that prioritizes actual demonstrated security measures.
- VISS differs from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) by not focusing on worst-case scenarios and attempting to more objectively measure the impact of vulnerabilities from a defender's perspective.
- To this aim, [VISS](https://github.com/zoom/viss/blob/main/VISS_User_Guide.pdf) provides a web-based UI to calculate the vulnerability score based on several parameters — categorized into platform, infrastructure and data groups — including the impact on the platform, the number of tenants impacted, data impact and more.
- Although we don't have too much practical experience with this specific tool yet, we think this kind of priority-tailored assessment approach based on industry and context is worth practicing.
