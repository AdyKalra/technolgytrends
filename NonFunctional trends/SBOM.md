## Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)


* With continued pressure to keep systems secure and no reduction in the general threat landscape, a machine-readable Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) may help teams stay on top of security problems in the libraries that they rely on. 
* Since the original [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) was published, the industry has gained clarity and understanding of what an SBOM is and how to create one; the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), for example, now has more [specific advice on how to comply with the order.](https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-14028-improving-nations-cybersecurity/software-security-supply-chains-software-1) 
* We've had production experience using SBOMs on projects ranging from small companies to large multinationals and even government departments, and we're convinced they provide a benefit.
* More organizations and governments should consider requiring SBOMs for the software they use. The technique will be strengthened by the new tools that continue to emerge, such as the [Firebase Android BOM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/learn-more#bom) that automatically aligns an application's library dependencies to those listed in the BOM.
