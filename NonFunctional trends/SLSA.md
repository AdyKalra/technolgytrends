## SLSA

https://slsa.dev/

* As software continues to grow in complexity, the threat vector of software dependencies becomes increasingly challenging to guard against. **Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts, or SLSA (pronounced "salsa"), is a consortium-curated set of guidance for organizations to protect against supply chain attacks, evolved from internal guidance Google has been using for years.** 

### What is SLSA?

**Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts, or SLSA (salsa).**

**It’s a security framework, a check-list of standards and controls to prevent tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure in your projects, businesses or enterprises. It’s how you get from safe enough to being as resilient as possible, at any link in the chain.**

* We appreciate that SLSA doesn't promise a "silver bullet," tools-only approach to securing the supply chain, but it does provide a checklist of concrete threats and practices along a maturity model. 
* The threat model is easy to follow with real-world examples of attacks, and the requirements provide guidance to help organizations prioritize actions based on levels of increasing robustness to improve their supply chain security posture. 
* Since we first mentioned, SLSA has added more detail around software attestations with examples to track concerns like build provenance. Our teams have found SLSA to strike a nice balance between implementation guidance and higher-level awareness around supply chain threats.
