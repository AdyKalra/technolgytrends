# Data Driven Engineering
* Data helps IT leaders visualize how work is being done, the quality and quantity of output, and how they can improve the lives of staff. 

## Get an engineering metrics tool
* You'll need one to track successful engineering metrics, and several are available. Engaging your development team to understand their work better is key here. An effective tool will help them in understanding their work and how to get more done. 
What are the roadblocks? What works well? What is challenging?

* Try to get your teams to engage with the numbers, and suggest ways to use them. Homegrown metrics that your team sees as serving them or their fellow developers are the way to go. You can make suggestions, but the more that this is owned by the people building your software, the better.

## Go beyond the numbers
* Data-driven software engineering produces benefits well beyond the numbers if you have an effective process or framework that reduces pain points and drives success. As your organization moves toward digital transformation, you'll need to have a greater focus on delivering value. With these metrics in place, the value you deliver will be measurable, and your employees will be engaged and happy to contribute to the organizationâ€™s success.
