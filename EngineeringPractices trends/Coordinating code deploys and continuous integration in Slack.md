# Coordinating code deploys and continuous integration in Slack
## Overview
* Software development at large organizations often entails dozens, even hundreds, of programmers working concurrently on millions of lines of code. Their success, however, is measured by a more precise metric: how quickly they can get what they build into their customers’ hands.
* Slack is a powerful addition to the toolchain of apps required to properly test, document and deploy code. It acts as a discussion space to foster collaboration and help support the efforts of engineering teams but also as a centralized, long-term record of what’s taken place, which includes most of the other apps your team may use.
* Here at Slack, we deploy dozens of code changes to production servers multiple times a day. To get the granular details of our in-house process, check out our post on [Code Deploys]()
