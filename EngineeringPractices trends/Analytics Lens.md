### Analytics Lens
* The new Analytics Lens offers comprehensive guidance to make sure that your analytics applications are designed in accordance with AWS best practices. The goal is to give you a consistent way to design and evaluate cloud architectures, based on the following five pillars of the well architected framework:
  * Operational excellence
  * Security
  * Reliability
  * Performance efficiency
  * Cost optimization
  
* The **Analytics Lens models both the data architecture at the core of the analytics applications and the application behavior itself.** These models are organized into the following six areas, which encompass the vast majority of analytics workloads deployed on AWS:

 1. Data ingestion
 2. Security and governance
 3. Catalog and search
 4. Central storage
 5. Processing and analytics
 6. User access

* There are a number of common scenarios where the Analytics Lens applies, such as the following:
  * Building a data lake as the foundation for your data and analytics initiatives
  * Efficient batch data processing at scale
  * Building a platform for streaming ingest and real-time event processing
  * Handling big data processing and streaming
  * Data-preparation operations
  
 * **Applying the lens to your existing architectures can validate the stability and efficiency of your design (or provide recommendations to address the gaps that are identified). AWS is committed to the Analytics Lens as a living tool; as the analytics landscape evolves and new AWS services come on line, weâ€™ll update the Analytics Lens appropriately. Our mission will always be to help you design and deploy well-architected applications.**
