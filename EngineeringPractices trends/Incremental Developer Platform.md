## Incremental Developer Platform

* The Team Topologies book has done a great job of describing the ideal of a platform that supports developers with "self-service APIs, tools, services and knowledge." However, we often see teams shooting for too much of that platform vision too fast. Instead, building an incremental developer platform is key.

* Team Topologies recommends to always strive for what they call the **"Thinnest Viable Platform"** necessary at any given stage, where the first version could even be just a set of documentation on a wiki. 
* The next increment could increase the service level by providing templates or allowing teams to create pull requests. 
* Further increments could then introduce self-service APIs, but only if valuable. 
* In short, even though we've cautioned against fully ticket-driven platform operating models, going from zero to self-service is the other extreme. **Pace yourself, treat your platform as a product and build it up incrementally.**
