## Adaptive, Socio-Technical Systems with Architecture for Flow: Wardley Maps, DDD, and Team Topologies
[Source](https://www.infoq.com/articles/adaptive-socio-technical-systems-flow/)

- When building and improving adaptive, socio-technical systems, we need to consider the system as a whole instead of focusing on local optimization of separate parts. We need a holistic approach that involves perspectives from business strategy, software architecture and design, and team organization, e.g., by combining Wardley Mapping, Domain-Driven Design, and Team Topologies
##### A Wardley Map - as a part of Wardley Mapping - provides a structured way from a business strategy point of view to discuss and visualize the landscape in which an organization is operating and competing. It helps to anticipate change and identify areas where an organization can innovate, improve efficiency, or outsource to gain a competitive advantage
##### Team Topologies’ well-defined team types and interaction help teams to adapt quickly to new circumstances and achieve fast and sustainable flow of change from a team perspective
##### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) helps to discover the core domain providing competitive advantage and leverage modularity with bounded contexts as suitable seams to split a system apart and well-defined ownership boundaries from a software design perspective
- The combination of Wardley Mapping, DDD, and Team Topologies provides a powerful holistic toolset to design, build, and evolve adaptive socio-technical systems that are optimized for a fast and sustainable flow of change and can evolve and thrive in the face of constant change  

- In a world of rapid changes and increasing uncertainties, organizations must continuously adapt and evolve to remain competitive and excel in the market. Designing for adaptability sounds easier said than done. How do you design and build systems that can evolve and thrive in the face of constant change? My suggestion is to take a holistic approach that combines different viewpoints from business strategy, software architecture, and team organization.

### A systemic approach for optimizing organizations
- Most initiatives that try to change or optimize a system are usually directed at improving parts taken separately. They tend to focus on the local optimization of separate parts of the system.

- According to Dr. Russell Ackoff - one of the pioneers of system thinking - local optimization of separate parts of a system will not improve the performance of the whole. He stated that "a system is more than the sum of its parts. It’s a product of their interactions. The way parts fit together determines the performance of a system - not on how they perform taken separately." In addition, when building systems in general, we need to consider effectiveness (building the right thing) and efficiency (building the thing right).

- Building the right thing addresses questions related to effectiveness, such as how aligned our solution is to user needs. Creating meaningful value for its customers is vital for an organization's success. That involves understanding the problem and sharing a common understanding. Building the thing right focuses on efficiency, in particular, the efficiency of engineering practices. Efficiency is about utilization. It’s not only crucial to generate value but also to be able to deliver that value well. It’s about how fast we can deliver changes, how quickly and easily we can make a change effective and adapt to new circumstances. The one (building the right thing) does not go without the other (building the thing right). But as Dr. Russell Ackoff points out, "doing the wrong thing right is not nearly as good as doing the right thing wrong."

### Designing organizations for adaptability
- To build adaptive, socio-technical systems that can evolve and thrive in the face of constant change - with effectiveness and efficiency in mind to build the right thing right and considering the whole -  we need a holistic approach combining various perspectives. It requires understanding the context-specific business landscape in which an organization is operating and competing, including the external forces impacting the landscape, in order to design effective business strategies. It requires gaining domain knowledge and understanding the business domain to build a system that is closely aligned with the business needs and strategy. It requires aligning not only the technical solution but also aligning the teams and evolving their interactions to the system we build and the strategy we plan.

- Or in other words: one approach to designing, building, and evolving adaptive, socio-technical systems optimized for a fast flow of change could be connecting the dots between Wardley Mapping, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Team Topologies as Architecture for Flow.

##### A Wardley Map is just one part of Wardley Mapping. In general, Wardley Mapping helps to design and evolve effective business strategies based on situational awareness and movement following a strategy cycle. Figure 6 illustrates the strategy cycle that "is a representation of change and how we need to react to it", according to Simon Wardley.
