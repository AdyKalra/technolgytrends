### Going where the data takes you 
* Elasticity means “bending rather than breaking” when customer needs change, when data calls business strategies into question, and even “when the capabilities that were just a few years ago regarded as exhaustive of your core capabilities, now barely touch the size of what’s required for you to compete in a digitally charged environment,”

* “To survive, organisations may well decide to become much flatter in their organisational structure,” 
* “That will mean leaders will actually be closer to the employees, which I think psychologically and physically is a better thing as we go forward into a more progressive future - because that will make leaders more responsible.” 

* In a ‘flat’ enterprise, leaders are more willing to entrust decisions to the people and teams best placed to make them. “Gone are the days where leaders sit in a room and dictate and direct,”
* “Leaders are not perfect and we’re certainly not all-seeing. As soon as we recognise that, and unleash the power that exists in our business and give people the closest to the opportunity to drive the change, we’ll get where we need to be quicker.”

* A defining trait of effective digital leadership is the recognition that effective decision-making “has got to be data-driven,” he added.
