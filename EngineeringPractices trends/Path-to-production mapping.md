## Path to Production Mapping

* Although path-to-production mapping has been a near-universal practice at Thoughtworks since codifying Continuous Delivery, we often come across organizations unfamiliar with the practice. 
* The activity is most often done in a **workshop with a cross-functional group of people — that includes everyone involved in designing, developing, releasing and operating the software — around a shared whiteboard (or virtual equivalent).** 
  * First, the steps in the process are listed in order, from the developer workstation all the way to production. 
  * Then, a facilitated session is used to capture further information and pain points. 

* The most common technique we see is based on [value-stream mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping), although plenty of process map variants are equally valuable. 
* The activity is often eye-opening for many of the participants, as they identify delays, risks and inconsistencies and continue to use the visual representation for the continuous improvement of the build and deploy process. 
* We consider this technique so foundational!!
