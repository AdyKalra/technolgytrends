## Path to Production Mapping

* Although path-to-production mapping has been a near-universal practice at Thoughtworks since codifying Continuous Delivery, we often come across organizations unfamiliar with the practice. 
* The activity is most often done in a **workshop with a cross-functional group of people — that includes everyone involved in designing, developing, releasing and operating the software — around a shared whiteboard (or virtual equivalent).** 
  * First, the steps in the process are listed in order, from the developer workstation all the way to production. 
  * Then, a facilitated session is used to capture further information and pain points. 

* The most common technique we see is based on [value-stream mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping), although plenty of process map variants are equally valuable. 
* The activity is often eye-opening for many of the participants, as they identify delays, risks and inconsistencies and continue to use the visual representation for the continuous improvement of the build and deploy process. 
* We consider this technique so foundational!!


### Detailed Steps

A path to production maps the steps, people, tools, tasks and output for software request/change to reach production.

It is a great technical inception activity for fostering conversations about cross functional requirements, build pipeline, continuous delivery and quality. It is very useful to make it visible the overall process time with all the queues and wait times.

Step by step

1. Ask the participants to represent the step by step of a new code (or fix/change) takes from the developer machine to the final product artefact (usually deployed in the production environment)
2. For each step, add notes under it for a few categories; for example: people, tools, tasks and output
3. Consider renaming the categories for your specific context


Note for Lean Inception facilitators
I have used Path to Production on many technical inceptions, but, at times, I use it on Lean Inceptions for one of the following two reason:
1. I’ll use the path to production in a Lean Inception that needs to raise the attention to the build pipeline (needed for pushing the MVP features to production).
2. I’ll use the path to production in a Lean Inception that the product itself is very technical (for example a platform, a cloud or a pipeline). In such cases, I keep the Lean Inception agenda, but I’ll adapt it as needed; for example I’ll rename an activity from ‘User Journey’ to ‘Code Journey’

Now let’s look at a software delivery process of a team that uses a hybrid of agile and waterfall methodologies:
