[DORA](https://dora.dev/research) Core represents a distillation of DORAâ€™s most foundational findings: metrics, capabilities, and outcomes that the research has repeatedly surfaced.

DORA Core was designed to evolve: as the research progresses, and as practitioners develop ways to apply it, we adapt Core to be of continued utility.
Core 1.0 was released in July 2023. The current published version, v1.2.2, contains small refinements.
Since 1.0 was published, DORA has released Accelerate State of DevOps Report 2023, and the DORA Community has collectively enhanced our shared expertise. This document proposes version 2.0 of DORA Core, reflecting new and updated knowledge.
