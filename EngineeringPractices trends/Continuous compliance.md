**Continuous compliance** is the practice of ensuring that software development processes and technologies comply with industry regulations and security standards on an ongoing basis, by heavily leveraging automation. 
- Manually checking for security vulnerabilities and adhering to regulations can slow down development and introduce errors.
- As an alternative, organizations can automate compliance checks and audits. They can integrate tools into software development pipelines, allowing teams to detect and address compliance issues early in the development process.
- Codifying compliance rules and best practices helps enforce policies and standards consistently across teams.
- It enables you to scan code changes for vulnerabilities, enforce coding standards and track infrastructure configuration changes to ensure they meet compliance requirements.
- Lastly, automated reporting of the above simplifies audits and provides clear evidence of compliance.
- Techniques like publishing [SBOMs](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/software-bill-of-materials) and applying the recommendations from [SLSA](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/slsa) â€” can be very good starting points.
- The benefits of this technique are multifold. First, automation leads to more secure software by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities early and, second, development cycles accelerate as manual tasks are eliminated.
- Reduced costs and enhanced consistency are additional perks. For safety-critical industries like software-driven vehicles, automated continuous compliance can improve the efficiency and reliability of the certification process, ultimately leading to safer and more reliable vehicles on the road.
