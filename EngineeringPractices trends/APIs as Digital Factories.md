* Software is shifting away from being a department to becoming a competitive advantage, making it a lever to drive growth in your market

### What are the big challenges? 
* Give software access to legacy systems (IT) where the business runs Make innovation for all customers, all distributions, all employees Make sure the first items leaving the tech factory are competitive advantages (for all customers, all distributions, all employees)
* Harmonize cultures through common languages and rituals (market, technique, logistics, R&D...) 
* Define and promote data through operational and measured cases
* Use digital to redefine and become the industry standard on your difference 1 2 3 4 5 6
