# DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Reference Design 
## Executive Summary 
* Legacy software acquisition and development practices in the DoD do not provide the agility to deploy new software “at the speed of operations”. In addition, security is often an afterthought, not built in from the beginning of the lifecycle of the application and underlying infrastructure. 
* DevSecOps is the industry best practice for rapid, secure software development. DevSecOps is an **organizational software engineering culture** and practice that aims at unifying software development (Dev), security (Sec) and operations (Ops). The main characteristic of DevSecOps is to automate, monitor, and apply security at all phases of the **software lifecycle: plan, develop, build, test, release, deliver, deploy, operate, and monitor.**  
* In DevSecOps, testing and security are shifted to the left through automated unit, functional, integration, and security testing - this is a key DevSecOps differentiator since security and functional capabilities are tested and built simultaneously. 
* The benefits of adopting DevSecOps include: 
    * Mean-time to production: the average time it takes from when new software features are required until they are running in production. 
    * **Lead Time** Average lead-time: how long it takes for a new requirement to be delivered and deployed. 
    * Deployment speed: how fast a new version of the application can be deployed into the production environment. 
    * **Deployment frequency**: how often a new release can be deployed into the production environment. 
    * **Change Fail Rate** Production failure rate: how often software fails during production. 
    * **MTTR** Mean-time to recovery: how long it takes applications in the production stage to recover from failure. 
* In addition, DevSecOps practice enables: 
    * Fully automated risk characterization, monitoring, and mitigation across the application lifecycle. 
    * Software updates and patching at a pace that allows the addressing of security vulnerabilities and code weaknesses.
