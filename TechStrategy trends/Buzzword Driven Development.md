- How Our Obsession With Trendy Tools is Creating Bloated Codebases and Incompetent Developers
    - The Day I Realized We Were Coding in Comic Sans I'll never forget the moment I watched a senior engineer proudly present a "cutting-edge" microservices architecture to solve a problem that could've been handled by a single Python script. The team nodded along, eyes glazed with the fervor of true believers. Meanwhile, I sat there — the new hire with 25 years of battle scars — wondering if I'd accidentally joined a tech-themed cargo cult.
    - **This wasn't innovation. This was programming as performance art.**


- We've let terms like blockchain, AI-driven, and cloud-native become the velvet ropes guarding VIP sections of our industry — while the actual work of writing clean, efficient code gets left in the coat check.
- I've seen startups burn $500k on Kubernetes clusters for apps with 100 daily users. Watched teams argue for days about React vs. Svelte while their product's core logic was held together by digital duct tape. We're not engineers anymore — we're magpies, hypnotized by anything shiny.



- Choosing trendy tools lets us:
    - Skip critical thinking ("The framework handles it!")
    - Impress stakeholders ("We're using AI!")
    - Avoid accountability ("It's not our code — the tech debt is the tool's fault!")
 
### The 3 Laws of Anti-Buzzword Engineering

Rules to avoid hype-driven disaster:
   1. **The Lawnmower Principle** "Never use a combine harvester to trim a bonsai tree." Match tools to actual problem size. Your mom-and-pop bakery doesn't need machine learning — it needs a working coupon system.
   2. **The Archaeology Clause** "If your team can't explain a tool's core principles, you don't get to use it." Bonus points if they can whiteboard it without mentioning ChatGPT.
   3. **The Legacy Litmus Test** "Will this still be maintainable when it's unpopular?"

### Rebelling Against the Hype Machine

Valuing craftsmanship over clout.
   1. **Build a "Tech Debt Museum"** Showcase abandoned projects in a Slack channel. Nothing humbles a team like seeing their $200k "NFT integration" outlived by a intern's Bash script.
   2. **Host "Naked Coding" Sessions** Solve problems with vanilla languages — no frameworks allowed. You'll rediscover the joy of creating instead of configuring.
   3.** Promote "VCR Repair" Engineers** Reward developers who fix old systems, not just those chasing trends. These are your true architects — the ones who understand how things actually work.
