#### Quotes from the book that help evolve your tech strategy and ways of working 

"Today’s most valuable architects modernize the organization’s way of working along with its technology stack. Steering clear of buzzwords, these architects tackle complexity, bring transparency, and make better decisions. They do so by riding the Architect Elevator: they forge the much-needed connection between the organization’s business strategy and the IT engine room, where the enabling technologies are implemented."

- It’s not just about technology and designing software. It’s about designing software and solving problems within a specific organizational context, and being aware of what’s happening around you, so that you can successfully navigate and influence that context where necessary.
- Architects realize they need to communicate and influence at different levels, with different audiences, both inside and outside of their immediate team environment.

### The Role
- It seems reasonable to want to know where we are, where we want to go, and how we are going to get there. But it was also based on a static view of the world, in which all change was deviation from a steady state.
- In today’s world, the technology running any organization must be dynamic, and the organization must be able to change that technology to adapt to economies of speed
-  Rather than focus on technical implementations alone, they must connect the organization’s penthouse, where the business strategy is set, with the technical engine room, where the enabling technologies are implemented.

  #### The Story
-  Aristotle already knew that a good speech contains not only logos, the facts and structure, but also ethos, a credible character, and pathos, emotions, usually triggered by a good story.
-  To transform an organization, you don’t need to solve mathematical equations. You need to move people, and that’s why you need to be able to tell a good story and paint a compelling vision.

#### Architects 
- Architects have an exciting but sometimes challenging life in corporate IT. Some managers and technical staff might consider them to be overpaid ivory tower residents who, detached from reality, bestow their thoughts upon the rest of the company with slides and wall-sized posters, while their quest for irrelevant ideals causes missed project timelines.
- What Architects Are Not - Developers often feel they need to become an architect as the next step in their career (and their pay grade). However, becoming an architect and a superstar engineer are two different career paths, with neither being superior to the other. 
- Architects shouldn’t ignore production issues, because they provide valuable feedback into possible architectural weaknesses. **But an architect that runs from one fire drill to the next won’t have time to think about architecture. Architecture isn’t operations.**
- IT architects can have many specializations: you’ll have network architects, security architects, software architects, solution architects, enterprise architects, and many more.
- For example, living in a house with great architecture in a poorly planned city with endless traffic jams but few public facilities is going to be equally frustrating as living in a house with poor architecture in a well-functioning city.
- architects deal with nonrequirements. This term doesn’t indicate things that aren’t required; rather, it refers to requirements that aren’t stated anywhere. This includes context, tacit assumptions, hidden dependencies, and other things that were never spelled out.
- “connect the dots”, see trade-offs,look beyond products, articulate strategy, fight complexity,
