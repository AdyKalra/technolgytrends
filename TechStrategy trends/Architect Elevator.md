#### Quotes from the book that help evolve your tech strategy and ways of working 

"Today’s most valuable architects modernize the organization’s way of working along with its technology stack. Steering clear of buzzwords, these architects tackle complexity, bring transparency, and make better decisions. They do so by riding the Architect Elevator: they forge the much-needed connection between the organization’s business strategy and the IT engine room, where the enabling technologies are implemented."
