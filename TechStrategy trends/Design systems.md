# Design systems

* As application development becomes increasingly dynamic and complex, it's a challenge to deliver accessible and usable products with consistent style. 
  * This is particularly true in larger organizations with multiple teams working on different products. 
* Design systems define a collection of design patterns, component libraries and good design and engineering practices that ensure consistent digital products. 
  * Built on the corporate style guides of the past, design systems offer shared libraries and documents that are easy to find and use. Generally, guidance is written down as code and kept under version control so that the guide is less ambiguous and easier to maintain than simple documents. 
* Design systems have become a standard approach when working across teams and disciplines in product development because they allow teams to focus. They can address strategic challenges around the product itself without reinventing the wheel every time a new visual component is needed.
