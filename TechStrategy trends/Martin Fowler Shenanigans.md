## Dev

* As software becomes more critical to modern business, software needs to be able to react quickly to changes, allowing new features to be be conceived, developed and put into production rapidly.
* The techniques of agile software development began in the 1990s and became steadily more popular in the last decade. They focus on a flexible approach to planning, which allows software products to change direction as the users' needs change and as product managers learn more about how to make their users effective. 
* This need to respond fluently to changes has an important impact upon the architecture of a software system. 
  * The software needs to be built in such a way that it is able to adapt to unexpected changes in features. 
  * One of the most important ways to do this is to write clear code, making it easy to understand what the program is supposed to do. This code should be divided into modules which allow developers to understand only the parts of the system they need to make a change. 
  * This production code should be supported with automated tests that can detect any errors made when making a change while providing examples of how internal structures are used. 
  * Large and complex software efforts may find the microservices architectural style helps teams deploy software with less entangling dependencies.

*  Refactoring is an essential technique to allow a program to be changed safely. It consists of making small changes that don't alter the observable behavior of the software. By combining lots of small changes, developers can revise the software's structure supporting significant modifications that weren't planned when the system was first conceived.
