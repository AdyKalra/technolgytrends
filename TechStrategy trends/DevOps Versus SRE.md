## DevOps Versus SRE

### Decoupling DevOps and RunOps — The Genesis of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
- DevOps and RunOps were decoupled, paving the way for SRE — a preventive technique to infuse stability in IT operations.
#### Software-First Approach: Brain Stem of SRE
- “SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team,” said Benjamin Treynor Sloss, VP of engineering at Google.
- This means an SRE function is run by IT operational specialists who code. These engineers implement a software-first approach to automate IT operations and preempt failures. They apply cutting edge software practices to integrate dev and Oops on a single platform, and execute test codes across the continuous environment. Therefore, they carry advanced software skills, including DNS configuration, remediating server, network and infrastructure problems, and fixing application glitches.

#### Error Budget
- threshold for permissible minimum application downtime, also known as error budget.

- principles of observability follow a cyclical approach, which ensures maximum application uptime.
